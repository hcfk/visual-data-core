# Visual Data Core Plugin System

Welcome to the plugin architecture of **Visual Data Core** — an open-source, modular data dashboard platform designed to be the next-generation alternative for real-time and historical data visualization. This document provides an overview of the default plugins shipped with the platform, and how developers can extend and contribute to the ecosystem.

Our plugin system is flexible, extensible, and intended to be **developer-friendly**, making it easy to integrate new data sources, build custom visualizations, and enhance UI capabilities.
